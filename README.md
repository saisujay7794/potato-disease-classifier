<h1>DR. Potato - A Potato Disease Classififier uisng CNN</h1>

<h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
         The Potato Disease Classification Model is designed to classify different diseases that affect potato crops. It is a deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on a dataset of labeled potato images.
    </p>

   <h2 class="section-title">Model Architecture</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            The model architecture consists of several layers including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense layers. These layers are responsible for extracting features from input images and making predictions based on those features. The architecture is as follows:

        <h2 class="section-title">Dataset</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of healthy potatoes and potatoes affected by various diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold. The dataset size is [insert dataset size here] without data augmentation and [insert dataset size here] with data augmentation.
