   <h2 class="section-title">🔭Overview</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
         The Potato Disease Classification Model is designed to classify different diseases that affect potato crops. 
         It is a deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on a dataset of labeled potato images.
    </p>

   <h2 class="section-title">🌐Model Architecture</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
            The model architecture consists of several layers including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Dense layers. 
            These layers are responsible for extracting features from input images and making predictions based on those features. 
            The architecture is as follows:

   <h2 class="section-title">🌱Dataset</h2>
    <p class="section-content">
       The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of healthy potatoes and potatoes affected by various diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold. The dataset contains over 54,000 images of 26 different plant species and 14 crop diseases. It was collected by researchers at Penn State University and is available on Kaggle.

    <h2 class="section-title">🤔Model Performance</h2>
     <p class="section-content">
       Without data augmentation, the model achieved an accuracy of 63.34% on the test set. With data augmentation, the model's performance improved to 98.3% on the test set.
